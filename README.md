# LiveBicepCounter

LiveBicepCounter is a Python-based application designed to count biceps curls in real-time using a webcam.
By leveraging computer vision technology with OpenCV and MediaPipe for pose estimation,
users can receive instant feedback on their workout progress with an on-screen display showing the rep count and a visual progress bar.

## Key Features:
- Real-time detection and counting of bicep curls
- Visual effects displaying rep count and progress
- Built with OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for accurate pose estimation
- User-friendly interface with keypress controls for interaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed on your computer along with the following packages:
- OpenCV (For image processing)
- NumPy (For numerical computations)
- MediaPipe (For pose estimation)

### Installation:
Install the necessary packages using pip by running the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```


Position yourself in front of the webcam and start performing bicep curls. The application will display the current rep count and a visual progress bar reflecting your form.

## Controls
'r' - Reset the rep count.
'q' - Quit the application.
